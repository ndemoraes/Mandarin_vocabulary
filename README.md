I have been learning Mandarin and decided to prioritize which characters I learn based on frequency in written texts and whether or not they appear on proficiency exams. Each chapter of my textbook has about 70 new vocabulary words. Some are not common and don't even appear on the highest proficiency exam level. I wrote this script to take the words I am assigned to learn and determine which I should prioritize because I never have enough time to learn all of them.
